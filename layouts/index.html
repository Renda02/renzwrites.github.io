    <h2>what i do</h2>
    <p>I started in Quality Management Systems (ISO 9001:2015), learning how to build processes that scale, document systems that work, and ensure compliance across operations. That foundation in systematic thinking shapes everything I build today.</p>
    
    <p>I moved into frontend development, then discovered technical writing—where I could combine my love for clear documentation with technical depth. Now I focus on what really excites me: AI automation and documentation infrastructure.</p>
    
    
    <p>I turn complex problems into clear project plans, design systems that fit into current CI/CD processes, and create improvements that work for large, global teams.</p>

    <p>Building systems that make complex work manageable, documented, and repeatable.</p>
