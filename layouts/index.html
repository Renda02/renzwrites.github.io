<section>

    <p>My work sits at the intersection of AI automation, docs operations, docs tooling, and technical feasibility for project initiatives. Currently building intelligent tools that automate documentation workflows and cross-functional communication while bridging the gap between technical implementation and product strategy.</p>
    <p>I started in Quality Management Systems (ISO 9001:2015), learning how to build processes that scale, document systems that work, and ensure compliance across operations. That foundation in systematic thinking shapes everything I build today.</p>
    <p>I moved into frontend development, then discovered technical writing—where I could combine my love for clear documentation with technical depth. Now I focus on what really excites me: AI automation and documentation infrastructure.</p>
    <p>I turn complex problems into clear project plans, design systems that fit into current CI/CD processes, and create improvements that work for large, global teams.</p>

    <h2>personal life</h2>
    <p>I love reading books, hanging out with my daughter, and exploring brunch spots with friends. I've completed the 75 Hard challenge three times in a row. Wednesdays are for painting lessons. I'm an amapiano girl and love sharing music with my colleagues—after all, I'm South African!</p>
