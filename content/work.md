I've spent the last 2 years leading cross-functional docs operations initiatives including platform migrations, localization projects, and process adoption. Here's how I approach this work:

**Proactive**: I actively seek and test new technologies and approaches to solve complex problems.

**Solution-driven**: I approach every challenge with the belief that there is always a solution to be found.

**Resilient**: I’ve played a crucial role in solving complex documentation tooling challenges with optimism, creativity and determination.
